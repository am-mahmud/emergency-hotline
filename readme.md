### 6. Answer the following questions clearly:

1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

## Answer:
The differences between these query methods firstly getElementById, this is used as a method when have to find single, specific HTML element by its unique ID attribute, its perfect for those section which will be used for one single time

getElementsByClassName: I will use this when I need to get a collection of elements that share the same class name. It returns an HTML Collection, which is a live list, meaning it automatically updates if elements with that class are added or removed from the document.

querySelector / querySelectorAll: These are more modern and flexible methods. I will use them when I want to find elements based on any CSS selector, not just ID or class.

querySelector finds and returns the first element that matches the selector.

querySelectorAll finds and returns all elements that match the selector. It returns a static NodeList, which does not automatically update if the DOM changes.
